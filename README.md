# C#_FizzBuzz

The objective is to create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the 
number, for the multiples of five print "Buzz", and For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

I was able to create the console application using a for loop.  I used the variables x = 3 and y = 5 to represent the divisible numbers  
that way if I want to change the numbers I can change them in one place to reduce any introduction of bugs in my code.
